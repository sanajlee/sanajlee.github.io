## About Me

My name is Sangah Lee 이상아\[李尙娥\], an assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics at Seoul National University.
I am a computational linguist interested in reasoning abilities of LLMs, linguistic probing of LLMs, and multilingual/low-resource scenarios of language modeling.
I'm involved in the [Computational Linguistics Lab](http://knlp.snu.ac.kr/) of Dept. of Linguistics, SNU.


## Research Topics

* Various topics on Large Language Models
    * PLMs participated: [KR-BERT](https://github.com/snunlp/KR-BERT), [KR-BERT-MEDIUM](https://github.com/snunlp/KR-BERT-MEDIUM), [KR-BERT-KOSAC](https://github.com/snunlp/KR-BERT-KOSAC), [KR-ELECTRA](https://github.com/snunlp/KR-ELECTRA)
    * LLMs participated: [DAG LLM](https://dag.snu.ac.kr/)
* Linguistic probing of LLMs
* Reasoning abilities of LLMs
* Argument Mining
* Multilingual, multicultural scenarios of NLP
* Low-resource languages and their morpheme-aware tokenization
* And many other things with methods of computational linguistics!
